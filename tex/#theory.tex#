The Standard Model of particle physics is an extradinarly successful description of the fundamental 
constituents of matter and their interactions. Experiments over the past 50 years have verified the extremely
precise prediction of the SM; this success has culminated most recently in the discovery of the Higgs Boson. 
This chapter provides a brief introduction to the structure of the SM and how scientists are able to test it using 
hadron collider but focuses primarily on the physics of the Higgs boson and its decays to top quarks. 
Particular attention is given to the importance of a measurement of the rate at which Higgs Bosons are produced in 
association of top quarks in the context of our theoretical understanding of the SM. 


\section{The Standard Model}

The Standard Model (SM) is an example of a quantum field theory that describes the interactions of all of the known
fundamental particles (with the exception of the gravitational interaction). It was developed over the course
of the course of many years as the result of both theoretical and experimental discoveries. Particles are understood to be
excitations of the more fundamental object of the theory, the fiel The dynamics and interactions of the fields 
are derived from the Standard Model Lagrangian, which is constructed to be symmetric under local gauge transformations
of the group $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$. $SU(3)$ is the gauge group for the color, $SU(2)$ is the gauge group
for weak iso spin, and $U(1)$ is the group for weak hypercharge. 

Gauging the symmetries demands the introduction of 8 massless gluons, 
or the boson (full integer spin) carriers of the strong force from the generators $SU(3)$ symmetry, and the 4 massless electroweak bosons, carriers for the weak and electronmagnetic forces
from the 3 generators of the $SU(2)$ and 1 generator of the $U(1)$ group. The gauge symmetry also allows the theory to be renormalizable, meaning that unwanted infinities can be absorded into
observables from theory in a way that allows the theory to be able to predict phyiscs at multiple energy scales. 
Singlets of the $SU(3)$ group are fermions (half-integer spin particles) called leptons (electron, muon, tau, and associated neutrinos) and do not interact with the strong, 
where as doublets of the $SU(3)$ group are called quarks (up, down, strange, charm, top, bottom) and do interact with the strong force. The SM is a chiral theory: the weak force
violates parity, as it only couples to left-chiral particles or right-chiral antiparticles. This in a sense suggests that right-chiral and left-chiral fermions are different
particles coming different fields, which are different representations of the weak-isopsin group.

So far, 3 separate generations of both quarks and leptons have been discovered, differing only by mass. The reason for this 3-fold replication is not known.
The heaviest of which is the top quark, discovered at the Tevatron in 1996. The gluon and the 4 electroweak bosons have also been found ($W^+$, $W^-$, $Z^0$, and $\gamma$). 


\section{Electoweak Symmetry Breaking and the Higgs}

Despite the simple structure of theory, the discovery of massive fundamental particles creates two sets of problems
both related to $SU(2) \times U(1)$ gauge invaraince. First, the force-carrying bosons must enter the theory without mass in order for gauge symmetry to be preserved. Second,
adding fermion masses to theory in an ad-hoc way allows the right-chiral and left-chiral fermions to mix. Since they
possesses different quantum numbers, as different representations of the weak-isospin group, this too breaks gauge invariance. 

To solve these problems, spontaneousy electro-weak symmetry breaking (EWSB) is introduced via the Brout-Englert-Higgs(BEH) mechanism. Massive scalar fields, in an electro-weak
doublets, are introduced into the theory with 4 degrees of freedom and a specific potential, which includes self-interaction provides the mechanism for spontaneous symmetry
breaking. The fermion fields interact with Higgs field with via a Yukawa coupling term, which unites the left and right chiral fields of a single particle type.  
The minimum of the potential does not occur when the expectation of the field is zero. The field eventually falls to a state, where it
aquires a vacuum-expectation value. However, a non-zero field must therefore point in a particular direction of weak-isospin space, breaking the symmetry.

The consquences of this spontaneousy symmetry breaking are tremendous. First, the universe is filled with the Higgs field at its new vaccuum expectation value. The theory
can be expanded around the new mininum and 3 of the degrees of freedom can be interpreted as the longitundinal polarizations of the $W^+$, $W^-$, and $Z^0$, while the 
4th remains a scalar field, called the Higgs field. The weak bosons thus aquire a mass and the yukawa couplings of the scalar field to the fermions now behave like a mass 
term at the new mininum. 


\section{Collider Physics and the Standard Model}

Although the SM structure can be set by specifiying the gauge groups, EWSB mechanism, and acknolwedging the 3-fold replication of the fermions, confronting the SM with
experiment requires the measurment of 25 free parameters, which are uncontrained from the theory. These free parameters include the fermion masses,
coupling constants, the angles and phase of the mixing between quarks, constants from the massive neutrino sector, and constants from the higgs and electroweak sector\footnote{ The electroweak sector includes parameters like mass of the $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^0$ bosons, the weak mixing angle,${\mathrm sin^2}\theta_w$, the fermi constant $G_F$, and Higgs Mass and vacuum-expecation value. These parameters however are not wholly indepenent. As discussed above, it is only necessary theoretically to specify the two parameters relevant to the Higgs potential and the two coupling associated with the gauge groups }.

Experiments have provided a number of measurements over the years of various parameters of the SM. Although the Higgs Boson was only discovered recently, its integration into the SM allowed the $vev$ to be constrained by other measurements of the electroweak sector, prior to discovery. While the Higgs mass could not be directly constrained via the electroweak parameters already measured, it could be indirectly constainted via its dependence on loop corrections from the top mass ($M_t$) and the W mass ($M_W$). The GFitter collaboration assembles all relevant electroweak obervable measurements into a statistical model and then allows certain measurements to float within their uncertainty to allow for parameter overconstraints among multple measurements. Figure XX shows the fitted constaints on 4 key SM parameters ($M_H$, $M_W$, $M_t$, ${\mathrm sin^2}\theta_w$ and actual measuremetns. The addition to the fit of the measured Higgs mass from the ATLAS and CMS collaborations creates a small tension, as the other observables prefer the mass to be much lower ($\sim$ 80 \gevcc). The tension in the combined electroweak fit (including the Higgs) is not statsitcally significant with a $p$-value of 0.07.

Particle physicists accelerate particles to extremely high energies and force them to interact through collisions or to collide with a fixed target. Typically, the particles accelerated
are electrons or protons, since they are stable. Electron-Positron collider machines have a rich history of discovery and measurement in particle physics. The advantage of
