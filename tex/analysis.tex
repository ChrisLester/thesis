\chapter[Search for the TTH Decay in the Multilepton Channel][Search for the TTH Decay in the Multilepton Channel]{Search for the TTH Decay in the Multilepton Channel}

This chapter introduces the set of analyses searching for the Standard Model (SM) production of the Higgs boson in association with top quarks in multi-lepton
final states with multiple jets (including b-quark tagged jets). Searches in $t\bar{t}H$ final states with 2 same-charge, 3 and 4 light leptons ($e, \mu$)
are discussed in depth. These final states target specifically Higgs decays to vector bosons, $H\rightarrow W^{\pm}W^{\pm}$ and $H\rightarrow Z^{\pm}Z^{\pm}$
and form a complement to searches for $t\bar{t}H$ production in final states targeting the $H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ \cite{paper1}, $H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$\cite{paper2}, and $H\rightarrow\tau\tau$
decay modes. All will be combined into a full ATLAS Run I measurement/limit on the full SM $t\bar{t}H$ production cross-section. The chapter is divided into the following sections: description the object and event selections and optimizations, methods for estimating background contributions, discussion of systematics uncertainties, and the final result and statistical treatment. 

\section{Data and Simulation Samples}

\subsection{Data}

The analysis searches the entire 2012 ATLAS dataset of proton-proton collisions at 8 TeV, collected
from April to October. The size of the dataset corresponds to 20.3 \ifb, after passing data quality
requirements, called a good run list, which ensures the proper operation of the tracking, calorimeter
and muon subsystems. \cite{} 

The datasets used in the analysis were collected with the primary electron and primary photon triggers,
whose requirements became more stringent throughout the data taking, in order to manage the the increasing instantaneous
luminosity. in Table
