This thesis presents preliminary results of a search for Higgs boson production
in association with top quarks in multilepton final states. The search
was conducted in the 2012 dataset of $\sqrt{s}=8$TeV proton-proton
collisions delivered by the CERN Large Hadron Collider and collected by
the ATLAS experiment. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of
20.3 \ifb. The analysis is conducted by measuring event counts in
signal regions distinguished by the number of leptons (2 same-sign, 
3, and 4), jets and b-tagged jets present in the reconstructed events. The observed
events in the signal regions constitute an excess over
the expected number of background events. The results
are evaluated using a frequentist statistical model. The
probability of a background fluctuation to the
size of the observed data is 0.002, corresponding to 2.86 $\sigma$,
and is, therefore, not considered a statistically significant observation. 
The observed exclusion upper limit at the 95\% confidence
level is 6.45 times the predicted
Standard Model \tth\ production cross section. The fitted value of
ratio of the observed production rate to the expected Standard Model
\tth\ production rate is 3.634 $+$ 1.582 $-$ 1.385.
