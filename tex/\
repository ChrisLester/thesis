The Standard Model of particle physics is an extradinarly successful description of the fundamental 
constituents of matter and their interactions. Experiments over the past 50 years have verified the extremely
prceise prediction of the SM; this success has culminated most recently in the discovery of the Higgs Boson. 
This chapter provides a brief introduction to the structure of the SM and how scientists are able to test it using 
hadron collider but focuses primarily on the physics of the Higgs boson and its decays to top quarks. 
Particular attention is given to the importance of a measurement of the rate at which Higgs Bosons are produced in 
association of top quarks in the context of our theoretical understanding of the SM. 


\section{The Standard Model}

The Standard Model (SM) is an example of a quantum field theory that describes the interactions of all of the known
fundamental particles (with the exception of the gravitational interaction). Particle interactions and dynamics
are derived from the Standard Model Lagrangian, which is constructed to be symmetric under local gauge transformations
of the group $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$, where $SU(3)$ is the gauge group for the color
